/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Dungeon" application.
 *  "Dungeon" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users
 *  can walk around some dungeon rooms and solve two basic puzzles. That's all.
 *  It should really be extended to make it more interesting!
 *
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 *
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser, creates items, and starts the game.
 *  It also evaluates and executes the commands that the parser returns.
